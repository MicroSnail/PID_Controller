# PID_Controller

Here you will find a Vivado project for a PID controller as well as associated C code that is used to set the parameters.

Tools you will need: Vivado 2016.2

To compile the Verilog code, you will need:
1. Xilinx [Vivado 2016.2](http://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html) FPGA development tools. The SDK (bare metal toolchain) must also be installed, be careful during the install process to select it. Preferably use the default install location.
